sprintPlanning: >
  Hello Everyone! :wave:


  We are 1 week away from commencing our Sprint. So we would like to take this opportunity to ask for your nominated issues here in this thread so we can assess, refine and coordinate with ourselves (the Core Team) and the community contributors on the upcoming priorities.


  If you are new to this sprint planning then essentially we are asking you, as the users, to post your issues (by referencing the GitHub hash/ID) that you would like to see being tackled. We, the Core Team, will review and select the achievable ones within the sprint and allocate them among ourselves. The others we may label them as Help Wanted which would make them up for grabs by our community code contributors. This process will help encourage ownership of these bugs and their bug fixes. [Find out more of the sprint concept here](https://docs.suitecrm.com/community/nominating-issues-in-sprint-planning) :point_left:


  Sprints are every 2 weeks with the aim to deliver a release every 2 Sprints (monthly).


  Just to re-iterate from previous posts, that the core team do have other tasks that may not be identified in the above sprints and these are usually from our own internal backlog i.e. improving the release process, CI/CD tools, security patches etc so that accounts for some ‘slack’ visible in the public sprints.


  Look forward to your nominations! :writing_hand:
